## Getting Started

Day 1 will cover:

* Launching Jupyter Notebooks
* Working with arrays using the Numpy package
* Importing text datasets using the Pandas package
* Creating simple graphics with Matplotlib

Day 2 will cover:

* Importing scientific data formats, such as netCDF and GRIB2
* Creating maps from datasets
* Running python scripts

Installation requirements

"I am really new to Python!"

* I recommend launching binder, which is a "cloud version" of this course. No installation required!

"I have used Python before!"

* If you wish to run the examples locally, I recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). If you are having trouble with your installation, contact the instructor before the course or use binder.
* Download the contents of the [GitHub repository](https://ter.ps/noaapy) to your computer.
* Launch Jupyter Notebooks from the Anaconda Navigator. This will open a window in your default browser. Navigate to the folder that contains the notebooks (*.ipynb) and click on the tutorial for the day.
* Additional packages:
  * Day 1: If you installed Anaconda, you will not need any additional packages
  * Day 2: Launch the Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (MacOS/Linux). Then copy/paste and hit enter:
    ```
    conda install -c conda-forge cartopy
    conda install -c conda-forge netCDF4
    conda install -c conda-forge pygrib
    ```
  * If there are no errors, then you are set-up!
  * Alternatively, if you are familiar with environments, you can use the environments.yml to install the necessary packages.

I *do not* recommend:
* Using Python on a remote server for this tutorial (I cannot help troubleshoot)
* Using your operating system's Python or a shared Python installations unless you are advanced!
